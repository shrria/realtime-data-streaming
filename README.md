# realtime-data-streaming

## Introduction

This repo contains examples of how to use different technologies to build a real-time data streaming pipeline. The examples are based on many videos and tutorials that I have watched and read. I have tried to make the examples as simple as possible so that they can be used as a starting point for anyone who wants to build a real-time data streaming pipeline.
